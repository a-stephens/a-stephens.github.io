    <h1>Alex Stephens Projects Website</h1>
    <a href="about.html">About me</a>
    <h2>The Beginning</h2>
    <p>This is the beginnings of learning to create a website from scratch using HTML.
        Should I succeed, this website will be available through a simple link on my resume.
        Other projects will be showcased on this website as well, to make viewing projects more digestible.
        To start, this is <a href="https://github.com/a-stephens">a link to my github.</a></p>

    <p>This is my favorite project that I've worked on.</p>
