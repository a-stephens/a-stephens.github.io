        <h1>The Beginnings</h1>
        
        <p>This is the beginnings of learning to create a website from scratch using HTML. Should I succeed, this website will be available through a simple link on my resume.</p>
        <p>Other projects will be showcased on this website as well, to make viewing projects more digestible.
            To start, this is <a href="https://github.com/a-stephens">a link to my github.</a></p>

        <p>Video of my minecraft base because I happened to make one? Let's see if I can figure this out and embed this thing. Unmute if you want audio.</p>
